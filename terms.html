  <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
      
  <h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
  <p>By installing, accessing, or using the re:fresh Gmail(TM) Add-on (the "Add-on"), you ("the user") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not install or use the Add-on. This is a legally binding agreement between you and the developer/provider of the re:fresh Add-on ("we," "us," or "the developer"). These Terms govern your use of the Add-on.</p>
  <p>Please note that your use of the Add-on is also subject to our Privacy Policy (see above), which describes how we handle your data. By using re:fresh, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the Privacy Policy and agree to its terms as well.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms in the future. If we make changes, we will follow the process outlined in the Changes to Terms section below. It's your responsibility to review these Terms periodically. Continuing to use the Add-on after changes are made means you accept the revised Terms.</p>
  
  <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>
  <p>When using re:fresh, you agree to use it in a responsible manner. You are solely responsible for your use of the Add-on and for any consequences that result. In particular, you agree to the following responsibilities and restrictions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compliance with Laws and Google Policies</strong>: You will use the Add-on in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Google's own policies. This includes not using the Add-on in a way that violates Gmail(TM)'s terms of service or Google's program policies. You should not use re:fresh to do anything that would be illegal or unauthorized if done manually (for example, you must not use it to harass someone or to send unlawful content).</li>
    <li><strong>Appropriate Use of the Add-on</strong>: You will only use re:fresh for its intended purpose of helping manage your own Gmail(TM) inbox. Do not misuse the Add-on. Misuse includes, but isn't limited to: attempting to use it on someone else's account without permission, using it to send spam or mass unsolicited messages, or trying to exploit the Add-on to do things it wasn't designed to do. The Add-on is intended to send polite auto-replies and organize your inbox – it is not a tool for sending marketing emails or any form of abusive messaging.</li>
    <li><strong>Content of Auto-Reply Messages</strong>: You are responsible for the content of the custom auto-reply message you provide to the Add-on. You agree that your auto-reply content will not be offensive, defamatory, or infringe upon anyone's rights (such as privacy, copyright, or other intellectual property rights). We (the developer) are not responsible for the text you choose to send via the Add-on. Please ensure that your message is appropriate and lawful, as it will be sent out to other parties on your behalf.</li>
    <li><strong>No Tampering or Reverse Engineering</strong>: You will not attempt to copy, modify, decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise tamper with the Add-on's code or functionality. The Add-on is provided to you for use as-is; any attempt to extract the source code, defeat the security features, or extend it in unauthorized ways is prohibited. Likewise, you will not attempt to bypass the permissions or access controls put in place by Google or by the Add-on.</li>
    <li><strong>No Harmful Activities</strong>: You will not use the Add-on to transmit viruses, malware, or any harmful code. You will not use the Add-on in a manner that could damage, disable, or impair the operation of Gmail(TM), Google's services, or others' use of the same. Essentially, don't use re:fresh in any way that causes harm or disruption to any service, system, or other users.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Security</strong>: You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google account and the device on which you use Gmail(TM). If you install the Add-on, ensure that your Google login credentials remain confidential. Do not share access to your Google account with unauthorized persons, as they could misuse the Add-on under your account. If you suspect that someone has gained unauthorized access to your Google account or the Add-on, you should revoke the Add-on's permissions and secure your account immediately. We recommend using Google's security features (like two-factor authentication) to protect your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations of Use</strong>: You understand that the Add-on may impose certain limits (for example, Gmail(TM) itself has daily sending limits for emails). You agree not to attempt to circumvent those limits. If the Add-on or Gmail(TM) stops you from performing an action (like sending too many emails in a short time), you will not try to use other means to overcome that restriction. These limits are often in place for security or to prevent abuse, and you should respect them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By following these guidelines, you help ensure that re:fresh remains useful and available for everyone. If you violate any of the above responsibilities, we may (at our discretion) terminate your access to the Add-on and you may also be in violation of Google's policies, which could lead to further action on Google's side (such as Google revoking the Add-on or other consequences).</p>
  
  <h3>Limitations of Liability</h3>
  <p>Please read this section carefully – it limits the liability of the Add-on's developer. We are providing you this Add-on to help you manage your email, but we cannot accept liability for certain kinds of problems. By using the Add-on, you agree to these limitations on our liability:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>As-Is, No Warranty</strong>: re:fresh is provided to you "as is" and "as available," without any warranties of any kind. We make no promises or guarantees that the Add-on will be perfect. In particular, we do not guarantee that the Add-on will meet all your requirements, or that it will always operate uninterrupted or error-free, or that any defects will be corrected. Use of the Add-on is at your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</li>
    <li><strong>No Indirect Damages</strong>: To the maximum extent allowed by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of or relating to your use of (or inability to use) the Add-on. This means that if using the Add-on causes any kind of problem such as lost emails, lost data, being unable to find an email, damage to your relationships or business due to missed communications, or any other intangible loss, we are not responsible for those consequences. For example, if an important email was archived by the Add-on and you missed it, or if someone didn't get your auto-reply for some reason, any resulting issues are not something you can hold us liable for. You assume full responsibility for any outcomes that result from the use of the Add-on.</li>
    <li><strong>Limit on Direct Damages</strong>: In the unlikely event that we are found liable for any claim arising from your use of the Add-on, our total cumulative liability will be limited to the amount (if any) that you paid for the Add-on's use. (Most likely, re:fresh is provided free of charge. If it is free, then our liability to you is zero dollars.) This limitation applies to any and all claims, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. In plain language, we are not financially responsible for issues that occur from you using this free tool beyond, at most, refunding what you paid to use it — which is nothing in the case of a free add-on.</li>
    <li><strong>Exceptions</strong>: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitations of liability. If you are in such a jurisdiction, some of the limitations above may not fully apply to you. In that case, our liability and warranties will be limited to the minimum extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or restrict any liability that cannot be excluded by law. For example, certain consumer protection laws may confer rights that override the above limitations – we do not intend to override those rights where they apply. However, to the extent the law allows, we still disclaim warranties and limit our liability as described above.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember, re:fresh is essentially a helper tool that acts on your instructions. You are choosing to use it, and you are responsible for how it's used and the effects it has on your email. We do not assume liability for your use of the Add-on beyond what is described in this section.</p>
  
  <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
  <p>We may revise or update these Terms of Service from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated version of the Terms (for example, on the Google Workspace Marketplace listing for the Add-on or on our website where this document is hosted). We will update the "Last updated" date to reflect when changes were made. If the changes are significant, we will take reasonable steps to inform you of the update, such as by posting a notice in the Add-on's description or via an email/notification if appropriate.</p>
  <p>Your continued use of the re:fresh Add-on after changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the Add-on and uninstall it from your Google account.</p>
  <p>It's your responsibility to review the Terms periodically, especially if we've notified you that they've changed. We recommend checking the Terms and Privacy Policy occasionally so you remain informed about the rules and your rights when using re:fresh.</p>
  
  <h3>Contact</h3>
  <p>If you have any questions, feedback, or concerns regarding these Terms of Service, or if you need to contact the developer for any reason related to the Add-on, please reach out to us. You can contact the developer of re:fresh at <a href="mailto:q.hmd08@outlook.com" style="color: #fff;">q.hmd08@outlook.com</a>. We will do our best to respond promptly and address your inquiry.</p>
  <p>Thank you for using re:fresh. We hope it helps you manage your email more effectively. By providing this Add-on, our aim is to assist you while respecting your privacy and rights. If you have any issues or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact us. Happy emailing (and archiving)!</p>
